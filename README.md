docker build -t cmps4131-app .
docker run --rm cmps4131-app:latest
```

## Notes

- Previously, I made a Next.js application work with Docker, per the lab's instructions for matching my project's technology stack. However, for the simplicity of this lab, I changed it to a simple Hello World program. The Next.js version can be found in the `next-js-version` branch.
- Screenshots reflect the previous Next.js version.
